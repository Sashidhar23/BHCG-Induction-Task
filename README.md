# Task 1 : Interactive Module Viewer (Frontend)

We have to install React, FontAwesomeIcon - faPlayIcon, faTimes, faFileIcon to run the code.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Node.js & `npm install`

I used node.js for the task.
npm create vite@latest App --template react
cd App
npm install
This is the command to install the React.
npm install @fortawesome/react-fontawesome @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core
This is the command to install the dependencies.


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
