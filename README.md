I have taken up Task 1:- Interactive Task Viewer (Frontend). 
We have to download React, FontAwesomeIcon - faPlayCircle, faFileAlt, faTimes to run the code. I used them to enhance the look of the page.
I have done it with node.js
npm install installs all the dependencies.
npm install @fortawesome/react-fontawesome @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core
The above line is the command to install FontAwesomeIcon - faPlayCircle, faFileAlt, faTimes.
FontAwesomeIcon is used for the icons.
faPlayCircle is for play button icon used in video modules.
faFileAlt is for file symbol icon used in the article modules.
faTimes is for "cross" mark used to close the modal opened for the video.
npm start is the command for executing the code.
